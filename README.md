# React Code Challenge

## About

I was tasked to write an app (using React) which fetched and displayed records from an API.

Tech used:

- React to build app components
- Redux for state management
- Redux-Saga for managing application side-effects (async calls and such)

## Future improvements

- More tests
- Further improve UI

## Usage

Run application

```
npm run start
```

Run tests

```
npm run test
```
